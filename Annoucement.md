# 2024 Christmas Print Drive

If you have access to a 3D printer and would like to bring joy to child, then continue reading.

I have been given over 25+ rolls of Polymaker filament.  I have made a promise that I hope you folks can help me with.  I promised to produce Christmas toys with all of that I have received.

The problem is that I only have 2 printers at my house, and there is a deadline when I will need to ship the toys off for distribution.  I don't know when that will be, but I know I don't have a ton of time to run all of that filament through a printer. 

# The details

The Twitch channel @loyalmoses has partnered with Polymaker to provide filament to fans of his Twitch channel.  I manage to get a bunch from him.  I made a promise to use it print as many toys as I could and ship them to him for distribution.  

I am offering filament to anyone that wants help with this effort.  

## Requirements

1. Head over and read the [2024 Christmas Community Print Drive Printing Guidelines](https://print.thelmshow.com/pages/2024-christmas-community-print-drive-printing-guidelines)
2. Check out the [2024 approved toy models](https://www.printables.com/@LoyalMoses/collections/1503183)
3. Ask me for some filament. We will figure out a way to get it to you.
4. Print the models.
5. Send to myself or directly to @loyalmoses.  *details to come later*

# Things to remember

These are Christmas presents. If you wouldn't give the finished print to someone you loved, then it probably should be recycled.

It is **ok** if you try and fail.  There are tons of failures every year, but we still keep trying.
